Title: '3G Public Cellular Mobile Telephone Services  - Nation-wide Service Coverage'
Description: 'This indicator measures Nation-Wide Outdoor Service Coverage for the
  3G cellular network. Service coverage is determined by signal strength. The availability
  of service coverage is the ability of a cellular network to achieve the minimum
  signal strength of at least -100dBm. Under IDA''s 3G Public Cellular Mobile Telephone
  Service ("PCMTS") QoS framework, mobile operators are required to achieve Nation-Wide
  Outdoor Service Coverage of >99%. In order to better measure the end users'' experience*,
  IDA has used mobile handsets to collect the signal strength sample readings for
  all service coverage indicators starting from Q2 2013.'
