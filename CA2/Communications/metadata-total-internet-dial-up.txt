Title: 'Total Internet Dial Up'
Description:
  - 'The "Internet Dial-up Penetration Rate" includes: (i) subscriptions to paid Internet
    access service for all IASPs, including ISDN dial-up subscriptions; and (ii) subscriptions
    to free Internet access.  Following full telecom market liberalisation, the number
    of IASPs has increased considerably. Starting from Jan 2001, the published figures
    on the Internet dial-up market include contributions from such new IASPs. With
    the cessation of free dial-up Internet access offered by service providers by
    31 Mar 2008, the number of dial-up Internet subscriptions only covers paid Internet
    access subscriptions.'
  - ''
  - 'All figures for subscriptions are rounded to the nearest hundred.'
